## Introduction

MISA AMIS is a web application for managing assets of an organization. It is developed by [MISA JSC](https://www.misa.com.vn/).

## In this project, I use the following technologies:

**VueJS** is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

**Vuex** is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vueâ€™s official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.

**Vue Router** is the official router for Vue.js. It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.

**Ant Design Vue** is a set of high-quality Vue components out of the box. It is designed to develop enterprise-level background applications, and can meet the needs of most enterprise applications.

**Axios** is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. It is used to make HTTP requests to fetch or save data.

**Vue CLI** is a standard tooling for Vue.js development. It offers batteries-included build setups for a modern frontend workflow. It takes only a few minutes to get up and running with hot-reload, lint-on-save, and production-ready builds.

**I18n** is an internationalization plugin for Vue.js. It provides a mechanism to localize your web application.

**Sass** is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

**ESLint** is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. It is configured to use the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](

**Moment.js** is a JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
